opening excel file fails due to lock problems (not implemented)
copy paste same file cause file to be written again :( (cause second open success)
  createfile does not support all flags required...
open excel and changing... save different file and rename ??




locking encfs

map<filename, impl_file_handle>

class impl_file_handle
{
	std::string name_;
	bool is_dir_;
	uint64_t fh_;
}

{ filename, mutex } -> { is_dir, handle, locks, access, share }
map per filename, riferimento file in file_handle, lista file_handle da file

set_file_time with SetFileTime and CreateFile ??
rename
delete
not open file if no read/write
